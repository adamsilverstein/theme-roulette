A random theme at random times.

== Description ==

Randomly changes your site theme :) Chooses from installed themes, and switches to a random one on 50% of page loads. If you have fewer than 50 themes, installs a new theme chosen at random from the top themes on the WordPress.org directory.

Installs max 50 themes (over time) by default. Use the 'thmr_max_themes_to_install' filter to adjust the maximum number of themese this plugin will install.

Switches the theme 5 out of 10 loads (50 %) - adjust this setting with the 'thmr_times_to_switch_out_of_ten' filter.

WARNING: The plugin may create additional load on your server, and may bring your site down if the activated theme throws a PHP error.  This is a novelty plugin, use at your own risk!
